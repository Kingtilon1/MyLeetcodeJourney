# Sum of Strings

## Problem Statement
Write a function `sum_of_number_strings()` that takes in a list of strings `nums`. Each string is a representation of an integer. The function should return the sum of these strings as an integer.

## Solution
The solution is implemented in the `sum_of_number_strings.py` file.

### Usage
```python
from sum_of_number_strings import sum_of_number_strings

nums = ["10", "20", "30"]
total = sum_of_number_strings(nums)
print(total)  # Output: 60
