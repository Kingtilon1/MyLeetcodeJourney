# Is Happy Number

## Problem Statement
Write a function `isHappy()` that determines if a number `n` is a happy number. A happy number is a number which eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the square of each digit.

## Solution
The solution is implemented in the `is_happy.py` file.

### Usage
```python
from is_happy import isHappy

n = 19
print(isHappy(n))  # Output: True
